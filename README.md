# CloverUI☘️

CloverUI is an Android application designed for local Large Language Model (LLM) inference. It provides a graphical interface to load and interact with GGUF format models entirely offline.

## Features

* UI Design: A minimalist user interface focused on readability and straightforward navigation.
* Document Parsing: Supports reading small document files (.txt, .docx) to include their contents directly within the chat context.
* Chat Functionality: Includes essential chat controls such as message editing, response regeneration, and the ability to configure both system and user prompts.
* Theme Customization: Users can adjust the global accent color of the interface.
* Model Storage Options: Supports importing models via external storage direct-read mode (to save device space) or internal copy mode (for file stability).
* Model Architecture Compatibility: Supports modern architectures including the Qwen3.5 architecture, Qwen3's Soft Thinking mechanism, and the Gemma3n series.
* Dual-Language Support: The application interface is available in both English and Simplified Chinese.

## Technical Specifications

* Operating System: Android
* SDK Requirements: Minimum SDK 28 (Android 9.0), Target SDK 35 (Android 15).
* Inference Engine: The underlying text generation is powered by llama.cpp.

## Disclaimer

This application provides a framework for local computation only. CloverUI operates strictly offline and does not collect, store, or transmit any private user data, chat histories, or uploaded files to any external servers. The text generated by the AI models loaded into this application does not reflect the views or positions of the developer. Users are solely responsible for the models they choose to import and the outputs generated during usage.
