# CloverPal☘️-Not just offline AI

CloverPal is an **Android** application designed for **local/offline Large** Language Model (LLM) inference. It provides a graphical interface to load and interact with **GGUF format models** entirely offline.

## Features

* UI Design: A minimalist user interface focused on readability and straightforward navigation.
* Document Parsing: Supports reading small document files (.txt, .docx) to include their contents directly within the chat context.
* Chat Functionality: Includes essential chat controls such as message editing, response regeneration, and the ability to configure both system and user prompts.
* Theme Customization: Users can adjust the global accent color of the interface.
* Model Storage Options: Supports importing models via external storage direct-read mode (to save device space) or internal copy mode (for file stability).
* Model Architecture Compatibility: Supports modern architectures including the Qwen3.5 architecture, Qwen3's Soft Thinking mechanism, and the Gemma3n series.
* Dual-Language Support: The application interface is available in both English and Simplified Chinese.

## Disclaimer

This application provides a framework for local computation only. CloverPal operates strictly offline and does not collect, store, or transmit any private user data, chat histories, or uploaded files to any external servers. The text generated by the AI models loaded into this application does not reflect the views or positions of the developer. Users are solely responsible for the models they choose to import and the outputs generated during usage.

## Acknowledgements

CloverPal is built using the amazing work from:

* **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)**: Enables efficient inference of LLMs on local devices.
* **[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)**: The cross-platform native runtime powering the mobile experience using web technologies.
* **[marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)**: A low-level markdown compiler used for rendering chat responses.
* **[mammoth.js](https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js)**: Enables text extraction and parsing from document (.docx) files.

And many other open source libraries that make this project possible!
